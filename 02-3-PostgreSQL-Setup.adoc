=== Setting Up a Local PostgreSQL Database
In this section, we will set up a local PostgreSQL database to store our application's data.

==== Installation
Download PostgreSQL 14.5 from https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads. Once the download is complete, run the installer. You can stick with the default values for most screens.

The default installation directory should be fine.

Leave every component checked.

The default data directory should be fine.

Choose a password. _IMPORTANT: do not forget this password. You will need it later._

The default port number should be fine. However, there's no problem using a different port number in case a different app is using 5432 for some reason. Just remember your choice so that you know which port your app should connect to.

The default locale should be fine.

The summary might look something like this:

There's no need for other tools, so you can skip the Stack Builder after the installation by unchecking the checkbox.

==== Creating a Database
Once PostgreSQL is installed, you should be able to connect to your local instance by running the command `psql -U postgres` and entering your password (I hope you haven't forgotten it already).

A server can host multiple databases. Create a new database for the event registration app using the command
```
CREATE DATABASE event_registration;
```

Check that the database exists by running the command `\l`:
