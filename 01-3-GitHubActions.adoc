=== GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration

Conitnuous integration (CI) is at the core of Agile development. The act of writing, testing and integrating incremental amounts of code often serves to detect errors, bugs and integration pain points sooner. 

==== Setup CI Workflow and Template

. Go to your ronitnuous integration (CI) is at the core of Agile development. The act of writing, testing and integrating incremental amountepository and select _Actions_ in the repository menu tab. 

. Select _set up a workflow yourself_ linked just below the title.

Workflows are automated processes to run one or more jobs. Each .yml file contains a single workflow.

. Modify the contents of the main.yml to have the following content:

[source, yml]
----
name: Java CI with Gradle

on:
  push:
    branches: master
  pull_request:
    branches: master

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: Windows-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up JDK 16
      uses: actions/setup-java@v2
      with:
        java-version: '16'
        distribution: 'adopt'
        
    - name: Setup Gradle
      uses: gradle/gradle-build-action@v2
    
    - name: Execute Gradle build
      run: ./gradlew build

[NOTE]
The configurations in this YML file are used to determine the environment in which to run the specified GitHub action. Though not required, you will want these configurations to mirror the system you're developing on if you implement build actions for the branches you are solely responsible for to make debugging errors easier. On branches with multiple developers, use configurations that have as much commonality as possible.

Each part of the .yml is described below. For more detailed coverage of GitHub Actions, visit the documentation page link:https://docs.github.com/en/actions[here].
[horizontal]
name:: Name of the workflow or work step as it will appear in the Actions and workflow insight of the GitHub repository.
on[event]:: Trigger event that causes execution of workflow.
jobs:: Groups all jobs that run in the workflow.
runs-on:: Configures job to run on latest version of specified OS.
steps:: Groups together steps of parent job.
uses:: Specifies what action will run on the particular step
run:: Specifies a command to run.

All that's left to do is test to make sure it works. Go to local working copy of your repository and initiate a pull, add, commit, status and push command in that order. 

The result of workflow runs can be seen under the _Actions_ tab of the repository.

To gain more insight into a workflow run, select the workflow run from the list . Even more insight can be gleaned from independent jobs by selecting them from the list of jjobs as well.
